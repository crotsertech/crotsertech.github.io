Engineer by day, sleeper by night (if I'm lucky). Friend to all felines. I hold a theoretical degree in physics.
I am a Cyber Privacy Advocate, [DRM](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/) Abolitionist, [Teetotaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism), [Right to Repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Manifesto) supporter, Linux user, [IWW](https://www.iww.org/) member, and [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/about/) Associate Member.

|     ![System Sizer icon](https://github.com/crotsertech/System-Sizer/blob/main/system-sizer-64.png?raw=true)**System Sizer**|System Sizer is a quick reference program for generating the true capacity of a water softener. System Sizer automatically compensates for iron and manganese levels and will also factor in a 10% system reserve.|[GitHub](https://github.com/crotsertech/System-Sizer)|
|**Testman**|||
|**eFlowswitch**| eFlowswitch is used to detect water flow measured by a hall effect sensor and use that signal to de/activate a relay to operate chemical dosing pumps which make use of dry circut based flowswitches. (such as STENNER ECON FP PUMPS.)|GitHub
